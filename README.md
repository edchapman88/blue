# [blue](https://edchapman88.github.io/blue/) : Autonomous Cyber Defence for _Real-World_ Systems

`blue` paves the way to applied online learning on **_real-world_**, **_continuous-time_**, **_concurrently-running_** systems by bridging the gap between real systems and _MDP-assuming_ online learning agents.

Part of the [**R<sup>3</sup>ACE**](https://github.com/edchapman88/r3ace) project: _Replicable_ and _Reproducible Real-World_ Autonomous Cyber Environments, `blue` makes two important contributions:
1. `blue` - the executable blue program, with a library of helper modules
2. `markov` - a library defining the reusable abstract software interface (`blue` is an implementer of this interface)
